// Questions 
1. yarn dev didn't work but yarn run dev did. Why? What's the difference between the two?  
2. Conditional rendering for whether a user is logged in our not. See Router and the path '/' that is commented out. The ternary operator with an empty div? (See Login)
3. I have to hit login twice in order to login. If the redux state changes, does not cause rerendering of the components that are connected to the redux state?
